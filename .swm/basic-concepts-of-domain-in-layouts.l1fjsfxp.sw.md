title: Basic concepts of Domain in Layouts
---
Domain refers to the core business logic and data structure of the application.

In Layouts, the domain is represented by the `Layout` class, which defines the properties and behaviors of a layout entity.

The `Layout` class includes attributes such as `uuid`, `name`, `content`, `css`, `javascript`, `defaultLayout`, `dateCreated`, and `lastUpdated`.

The `uuid` is a unique identifier for each layout, generated automatically upon creation.

The `name` attribute is a mandatory field that must be unique for each layout.

The `content`, `css`, and `javascript` attributes store the layout's content and styling information.

The `defaultLayout` attribute indicates whether the layout is the default one.

The `dateCreated` and `lastUpdated` attributes track the creation and modification timestamps of the layout.

The `Layout` class also includes constraints and mappings to enforce data integrity and define how the data is stored in the database.
