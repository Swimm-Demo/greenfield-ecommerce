title: Basic concepts of Domain in Transactions
---
Domain refers to the core business logic and data structures of the application. It encapsulates the essential entities and their relationships, ensuring that the business rules are enforced.

In Transactions, the domain includes the `Transaction` class, which represents a purchase or order made by a user. This class contains various attributes such as `uuid`, `total`, `subtotal`, `shipping`, `taxes`, `status`, `orderDate`, and more.

The `Transaction` class also includes relationships to other domain entities like `Account` and `ShoppingCart`, indicating that each transaction is associated with a specific user account and shopping cart.

The domain logic ensures that all necessary fields are validated and constraints are applied, such as making certain fields nullable or not, and setting default values where needed.

Additionally, the domain layer handles the persistence of these entities, mapping them to the database and defining how they should be stored and retrieved.
