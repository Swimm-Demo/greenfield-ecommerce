title: Accounts Overview
---
Accounts refer to the user profiles within the application, encapsulating user-specific data and preferences.

Each account contains essential information such as username, email, password, and personal details like name and address.

Accounts also track user activities, including product views, catalog views, page views, and search queries.

The <SwmToken path="grails-app/controllers/greenfield/AccountController.groovy" pos="44:2:2" line-data="class AccountController {">`AccountController`</SwmToken> manages various account-related actions, such as registration, profile updates, password resets, and activity tracking.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/account/account_activity.gsp](grails-app/views/account/account_activity.gsp)</SwmPath> view displays detailed statistics of user activities, including products viewed, catalogs viewed, pages viewed, and searches performed.

Accounts can have different roles, such as customer or admin, which determine the level of access and permissions within the application.
