title: Basic concepts of Views in Layouts
---
Views in the `Layouts` directory are responsible for defining the structure and layout of different sections of the application. They use Groovy Server Pages (GSP) to dynamically generate HTML content.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/layouts/dashboard.gsp](grails-app/views/layouts/dashboard.gsp)</SwmPath> file sets up the layout for the dashboard section, including importing necessary resources like stylesheets and scripts, and defining the structure of the dashboard page with various HTML elements and GSP tags.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp](grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp)</SwmPath> file defines the main layout of the application, including the navigation bar, container, and footer. It uses GSP tags to include dynamic content and links to other parts of the application.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/layouts/admin.gsp](grails-app/views/layouts/admin.gsp)</SwmPath> file is used for the administration section of the application. It includes styles, scripts, and HTML elements specific to the admin interface, and uses GSP tags to dynamically generate content based on the user's role and permissions.

Dashboard Layout The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/layouts/dashboard.gsp](grails-app/views/layouts/dashboard.gsp)</SwmPath> file sets up the layout for the dashboard section, including importing necessary resources like stylesheets and scripts, and defining the structure of the dashboard page with various HTML elements and GSP tags.

Main Layout The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp](grails-app/views/layouts/main.gsp)</SwmPath> file defines the main layout of the application, including the navigation bar, container, and footer. It uses GSP tags to include dynamic content and links to other parts of the application.

Admin Layout The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/layouts/admin.gsp](grails-app/views/layouts/admin.gsp)</SwmPath> file is used for the administration section of the application. It includes styles, scripts, and HTML elements specific to the admin interface, and uses GSP tags to dynamically generate content based on the user's role and permissions.
