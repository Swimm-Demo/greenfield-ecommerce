title: Overview of Configuration Views
---
Configuration Views are responsible for rendering the user interface for various configuration settings in the application.

These views include settings for store information, email configurations, payment gateways, shipping options, and more.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/configuration/settings.gsp](grails-app/views/configuration/settings.gsp)</SwmPath> file provides the interface for store settings, allowing users to input details like company name, phone number, email, tax rate, and other store-specific information.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/admin/index.gsp](grails-app/views/admin/index.gsp)</SwmPath> file offers options for importing and exporting data, managing uploads, and generating development data.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/configuration/import_products_view.gsp](grails-app/views/configuration/import_products_view.gsp)</SwmPath> file facilitates the import of product data through a CSV file, detailing the required format and fields.

The <SwmPath>[grails-app/views/configuration/select_gateway.gsp](grails-app/views/configuration/select_gateway.gsp)</SwmPath> file allows users to select and configure payment gateways such as Stripe or Braintree, ensuring the application can process payments.
