title: What is Configuration Controller
---
The Configuration Controller is responsible for managing various settings of the eCommerce application.

It handles settings related to the store's general information, such as the store name, address, phone number, and email.

The controller also manages email settings, including SMTP configurations like the admin email, support email, username, password, host, port, and authentication details.

Payment settings are another critical aspect managed by the Configuration Controller, including configurations for Stripe and Braintree payment gateways.

Shipping settings are also handled by the controller, ensuring that all shipping-related configurations are properly managed.

The controller uses the <SwmPath>[src/main/webapp/settings/settings.properties](src/main/webapp/settings/settings.properties)</SwmPath> file to store and retrieve these configurations, ensuring that changes are persisted.

Security is enforced through the <SwmToken path="grails-app/controllers/greenfield/ConfigurationController.groovy" pos="105:1:9" line-data=" 	@Secured([&#39;ROLE_ADMIN&#39;])">`@Secured(['ROLE_ADMIN'])`</SwmToken> annotation, ensuring that only authenticated admin users can access and modify these settings.
