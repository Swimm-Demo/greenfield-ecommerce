title: Getting started with Shopping Cart Domain
---
The domain in the Shopping Cart refers to the core business logic and data structure of the shopping cart functionality.

It includes attributes such as `uuid`, `status`, `taxes`, `shipping`, `subtotal`, and `total` to manage the state and calculations of the shopping cart.

The domain also manages relationships with other entities, such as `Account` and `ShoppingCartItem`, to link the shopping cart to user accounts and individual items.

Constraints are defined to ensure data integrity, such as making certain fields nullable or setting up a sequence generator for the `id`.
